Introduction

  This guide is intended to assist users in developing Java reporting plugins for
  Maven that will contribute to sites generated by {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin/}<<<maven-site-plugin>>>}}
  or site pdf documents generated by {{{/plugins/maven-pdf-plugin/}<<<maven-pdf-site>>>}}.

  Any Mojo becomes a <report> Mojo when it implements {{{/shared/maven-reporting-api/}Maven Reporting API}}. Then a plugin
  may have some reporting goals and some build (non-reporting) goals.

  Work In Progress (external reports, Doxia Sink API vs generated markup in <<<target/generated-site/>>>)...
