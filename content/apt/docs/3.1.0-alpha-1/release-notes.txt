* Maven 3.1.0-alpha-1 Release Notes

  Maven 3.1.0-alpha-1 is the first release of the 3.1.x series.
  
  The full list of changes can be found in our
  {{{https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10500&version=18967}issue management system}},
  and is reproduced below.

** Major Changes

  The use of JSR330 in the core for extensions and in Maven plugins. You can read more about it in the {{{http://maven.apache.org/maven-jsr330.html}Maven and JSR330}} document.

  The use of SLF4J in the core for logging. You can read more about it in the {{{http://maven.apache.org/maven-logging.html}Maven and SLF4J}} document.

  The switch in the core from Sonatype Aether to {{{http://eclipse.org/aether}Eclipse Aether}}.

** Known Incompatibilities with Maven 3

  The significant change in Eclipse Aether with respect to API changes and package relocation will likely cause issues with plugins that directly depend on Aether.
  We are aware of the issues in the Maven Site Plugin, the Maven Dependency Plugin, the Maven Shade Plugin and Maven Project Info Reports Plugin,
  and have fixed them in recent releases. But this
  is a significant change and is likely to cause issues in any plugin that depends on the now deprecated Sonatype Aether. In the external plugin ecosystem, it is known
  that Tycho, the Android Maven Plugin and the NetBeans Module Plugin are also affected: the plugin developers are aware of this issue and will release
  a new version of the plugin to address this issue.


  We maintain a {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/AetherClassNotFound}list of affected plugins with fixed version}}:
  please report if you find another plugin not yet in this list.
