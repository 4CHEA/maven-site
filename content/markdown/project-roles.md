# Apache Maven Project Roles

The Apache Maven project is not just the software it produces.
The Apache Foundation has a phrase: “Community over code” which
is about how it is the community that grows around a project
that is the most important thing.

Everyone reading this is part of the Apache Maven community, 
and even if you are an invisible part of the Apache Maven 
community you are still part of the community.

There are many ways we can sort the people in our
community, we present the following as one such way.
Please do not take offence if you disagree with this
categorisation. It is important to remember that we are
a *community* not a *clique* so you are entitled to disagree
with others in the community. 

*Note:* the right to disagree with other people's opinions
comes with the responsibility not to deliberately cause offence
or discord.

## Informal roles

### Lurkers

People who do not use Maven at all, but have an interest in
the project. This can include people who are developing 
competing software tools to Apache Maven.

It would be great if the lurkers would come out of the shadows
and make themselves visible, but every community needs its
lurkers, so if you are a lurker sulking about on the fringes
of the Apache Maven project, know that you are a valued member
of our community. If you ever feel the need to change your role
we will welcome you with open arms… (and if we don't welcome you
with open arms, please advise the [Project management committee][3]
who are responsible for ensuring that the community is a healthy
one)

### Consumers

People who use Maven, but do not actively join the community.
This does not include people who are: subscribed to one of the
Maven mailing lists; active in a Maven user community (e.g. 
something like [stackoverflow][1]; submitting bug reports; etc.

Maybe Apache Maven is the perfect product for you and does
exactly what you need and want, and you never have a need
to ask questions about how to use Maven as it is immediately
obvious to you how one is supposed to use Maven… if that is the
case could you please consider taking a more active role in 
our community as Maven is none of the above to our minds
and you might have a point of view that we have missed.

If you do have issues with Maven (we all have issues with it
so there is nothing wrong in having issues with Maven) please
let us know:

* Submitting bug reports is the best way to let us know about bugs
* Asking questions on the [Users Mailing List][2] is the best way
get answers to questions.

As a last resort, other Maven user communities are another route
to getting more involved in the Maven community, but keep in 
mind that Apache Foundation projects are supposed to encourage
the community at the ASF, so you will get more eyes and a
quicker response if you engage directly with the ASF hosted
community.

### Users

People who use Maven and have joined the community. This includes people who have:
* Submitted a bug report
* Asked a question on the [Maven user list][2]
* Joined one of the other Maven user communities.

We hope your bug report has received some attention, if it
hasn't why don't you see if you can fix the issue yourself
and submit a patch?

We hope your question was answered, if it hasn't think of 
all the other users who's questions sit unanswered, how many
of them do you know an answer for (even if only a partial
answer)? Why don't you respond to their questions with the
answers you know? If everybody did that, your question would
have an answer. Pay it forward!

We hope your experience in one of the other Maven user 
communities is a positive one, so why not join the canonical
Maven user community and subscribe to the [Maven user list][2]? 

### Contributors

People who use Maven, have joined the Maven community and contribute 
back to the community. This includes people who:
* Submit reports of the results of testing proposed releases of
Maven and Maven plugins
* Answer questions on the [Maven user list][2] (or even other Maven user communities)
* Submit patches to resolve reported bugs in Maven or Maven plugins hosted at Apache.
* Help curate bug reports by identifying duplicate reports, or
related issues.

Keep up the contributions, you are a critical member of our 
community. If we like what we see, we may even ask you to 
consider taking a formal role in our project.

## Formal roles

### [Committers](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#committers)

These are those people who have been given write access to the
Apache Maven code repository and have a signed 
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][4] on file with the ASF.

The Apache Maven project uses a Commit then Review policy.

Committers are responsible for ensuring that every file they 
commit is covered by a valid CLA. 

### Emeritus committers

If a committer decides that they cannot currently continue with 
the responsibilities of a committer, they may elect to go 
emeritus. 

At any time an emeritus committer for the Apache Maven project
may decide that they want to become an active committer again
by informing the [project management committee][3]. The current
policy is that committer role reinstatement is automatic.

### [Project Management Committee](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc-members)

The Project Management Committee as a whole is the entity that 
controls the project. Membership of the Project Management Committee 
is decided by the board of the Apache Software Foundation based on
nominations from the Project Management Committee.

It is a long standing tradition of the Apache Maven Project that 
the Project Management Committee reviews the active committers
approximately every 6 months with a view to determining whether
any of those committers would be suitable candidates to 
recommend to the board for inclusion on the PMC. It should be
noted that this is simply a tradition and not a right. There
are significant responsibilities that accompany the PMC role
and as such if a person is not demonstrating those responsibilities 
they may not be nominated or their nomination
may be rejected by the board. Such decisions are not a 
reflection of the technical competence of the person, and 
indeed the person themselves may even decide to turn down the 
nomination. For that reason the results of such periodic reviews
are kept confidential.

The Project Management Committee has the following responsibilities:

* Proposing active contributors for committership.
* Binding votes in project decisions.
* Voting on release artifacts.
* <!-- TODO: get the rest of these -->

### [Project Management Chair](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc-chair)

For various legal reasons, there are certain things that the Apache 
Software Foundation can only delegate to an officer of the foundation.

The Project Management Committee is responsible for nominating
the lucky victim who gets made an officer of the foundation (subject 
to the approval of the board).

This person then becomes the interface between the board and
the project management committee. They do not have any other
additional gravitas in the project, it is the Project Management 
Committee as a whole that is responsible for the direction of the project.
