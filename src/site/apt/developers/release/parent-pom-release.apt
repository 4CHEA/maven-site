Releasing A Parent POM

  Releasing a Parent POM is much the same as any other Maven project. The following
  guide walks through most of the steps:

    * {{{./maven-project-release-procedure.html} Maven Project Common Release procedure}}
  
  Note that Parent POMs have particular conventions for managing and deploying the project site.

* Rationale

  To be able to publish a documentation of the parent POM without affecting released POM and <<<site.xml>>>,
  parent POM projects have a specific structure, with the addition of <<<site-pom.xml>>> and <<<src/site-docs>>>
  provind <<<mvn -f site-pom.xml site>>>:

+----+
|-- pom.xml
|-- site-pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- site
    |   `-- site.xml
    `-- site-docs
        |-- apt
        |   `-- index.apt
        `-- site.xml
+----+

  And the <<<index.apt>>> page not only contains instructions about the content of the parent POM, but
  it maintains an historic of pom releases links and diffs.

  Each specific step is done to maintain <<<site-pom.xml>>> and <<<index.apt>>> in sync with the release being realeased.

* Stage the release

  Before staging the release with usual procedure, you need to update <<<site-pom.xml>>> and <<<index.apt>>> to
  take the future release into account:

  [[1]] update <<<site-pom.xml>>> parent pom version to match the version being released,

  [[2]] update <<<src/site-docs/index.apt>>>: add a line in the history of <<<pom.xml>>> for the future version, referring
  to the future svn release tag and date. Hint: in the diff link, value for <<<r2>>> parameter is easily found by
  following previous version link and copying revision number.

  []

  Once these modifications are done, you can follow standard staging steps taking care to use the <<<site-pom.xml>>> pom,
  with <<<mvn -f site-pom.xml ...>>> command, each time the parent POM's site is generated.

* Staging the latest documentation

  Once the release is prepared, but before the release vote, the site needs to be staged.

  The parent POMs are configured to stage the documentation in a "versioned" directory
  such as <<</pom/asf-X>>>.

   [[1]] Stage the documentation for the current release version (not the new snapshot).

+------+
cd target/checkout
mvn -f site-pom.xml site site:stage-deploy
+------+

   <<Note:>> It requires Maven 2.1.0 or higher to successfully deploy to <<<people.apache.org>>> via SSH. Older Maven
   versions will fail due to <<<com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Algorithm negotiation fail>>>.

   <<Note:>> You should verify the deployment of the site on the Maven website
   (you need to wait {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html}the sync}}).

+-----+
http://maven.apache.org/pom/asf-X/
+-----+

   [[2]] Verify/change folder permissions to 0775 and files permissions to 0664. Log on to <<<people.apache.org>>> and
   change to the directory above the staging directory.
   Then run these commands:

+------+
cd /www/maven.apache.org/pom
find . -type d -exec chmod a+rx,g+w {} \;
find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
+------+

* Updating the Maven site

 Check out the maven site project from <<<https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk>>> or pull the latest
 changes if already checked out.

 Update the version number for the parent POM on the <<<src/site/apt/pom/index.apt>>> page.

 Commit your changes and then deploy the site.

+-----+
mvn clean site-deploy
